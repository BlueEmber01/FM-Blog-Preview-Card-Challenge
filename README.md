### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex

### What I learned

During this project I learned how to center a div using CSS flex instead of an absolute code. I also learned how to make the text color change when a users mouse hovers over the text. This project was a good challenge on how to apply different styles to each piece of text and to get the spacing between as close to the design as possible. 

### Continued development

In the future I want to continue to work with CSS flexbox to become more comfortable with it. I would also like to learn how to add more special effects to text using CSS.
